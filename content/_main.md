## Summary
I am current a PhD student at Aston University, UK. My research is focused on using state-of-the-art transfer learning and reinforcement learning to teach a robot manipulator with high-degree-of-freedom to learn complex skills from a human demonstrator. The research is funded by the EU CHRIST-ERA InDex project which lasts from 2019 to 2022.
