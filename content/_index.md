## Research
Yingyi Kuang is currently a Research Assistant at Aston University, UK. She is currently focusing on developing reinforcement learning algorithms for traffic control.
Her PhD research, funded by the EU CHRIST-ERA InDex project, was focused on using state-of-the-art transfer learning and reinforcement learning to teach robot manipulators with high-degree-of-freedoms to learn complex skills based on simulation and human demonstrators.

Research Keywords: {*Robotics, In-hand manipulation, Transfer learning, Imitation learning, Traffic Control*}
