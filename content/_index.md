## Research

Yingyi Kuang is currently a PhD student at Aston University, UK. Her research is focused on using state-of-the-art transfer learning and reinforcement learning to teach a robot manipulator with high-degree-of-freedom to learn complex skills based on simulation / human demonstrators. The research is funded by the EU CHRIST-ERA InDex project which is from 2019 to 2022.

Research Keywords: {*Robotics, In-hand manipulation, Transfer learning, Imitation learning*}
